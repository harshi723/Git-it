Today is 3 october 2022.
Everything is so normal, mundane but the mind is full of chaos. 
Days pass by, time continues to tick, the world keeps on moving yet this phase of life of figuring out things and making own decisions ain't so normal. 

Things were so much easier during childhood, didn't had free will in many cases but now figuring it out on own is not sweet.
